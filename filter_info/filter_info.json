    "description": "### This filter has less options than others on purpose. It prioritizes reducing visual ground item clutter (G.E, slayer, minigames) and saving the good colors for the nice drops. There's a high emphasis on text readability & clarity. It was built around a main account that loves slayer and PVM. All boss uniques have a custom color based on the boss, some non-boss items do have colors where it matters, and then everything else is color coded based on their value. I don't use icons to prevent lag. \nYou can track which version of this filter you have by this: Version 1.0",
